## Part 3
In lab I learned that we can use ssh to remotely connect our terminal on our personal computer to a computer in the basement. We can use ssh-keygen to set it up so that we don't have to enter the password each time we login. I also learned about how web servers use ports, and how websites hide the port in the URL because they use the default port.
